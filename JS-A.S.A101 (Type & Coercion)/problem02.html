    var x = 1;
    var y = 2;
    swap(x, y);
    console.log(x);

    /*
    Output: 1
    Reason: 
    - When declare x and y and add it as agrument in swap() equal to 2 parameter a and b. 
    - The swap() recvies 2 copy value of x and y mean 1 and 2. Inside the swap(), the code show
    the reveses value of a and b, but it will only happen with 2 local varibles with function scope in swap
    and 2 copied value of x and y. Outside the fucntion, 2 global variables x and y change nothing, that what
    is called "passed by value". 
    - For that reason, when log the x, the result is 1;
