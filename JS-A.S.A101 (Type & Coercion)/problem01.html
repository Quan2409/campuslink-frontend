    function empty(o) {
      o = null;
    }
    var x = [];
    empty(x);
    console.log(x);

    /*
    Output: [] - an empty array with no element inside.
    Reason: 
    - First of all, when declare x = [], the memory allocate the array and
    x will reference to the address of the memory where array is storaged. If assign x to new variabels
    such as y, both x and y with reference to the address of memory. 
    
    - Second, when declare an empty() with parameter o then call it and assign argrument x. In this moment, 
    both o and x are referncing to the address. If there are some change of the array from x, example: o.push(1), then 
    both o and x will change the array. 

    - Third, in the empty(), o is assigned null - meaning o is stopped to references to the array, but this is not affected to x,
    so when log x, it will return an empty [] as the beginning
